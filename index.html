		<p>This project is currently being done by one person in whatever time I can get to do it, so progress isn't like that
		of a team that works full time on apps like this. On top of that, as I learn new ways of doing this, previous
		parts of the app my become either redundant or could be made better. The aim is to eventually have something usable
		by the end of June or start of July.</p>

		<p>TravelReminder is first and foremost an experiment for myself to get used to Android development. 
		In this day and age apps are now an integral part of life, and knowing how to make one should be an important
		part of a computer scientist's repertoire.</p>
		
		<p>The premise is an app that a user can set a destination and an arrival time, and an alarm is created
		to remind to user to leave on time. For example, Paul needs to be at Jack's house at 3:00pm. Paul sets the
		destination in the app to Jack's house and the arrival time to 3:00pm. Paul also specifies that he will be
		walking to Jack's house.</p>
		
		<p>With this information, the app looks up directions and travel times and creates an alarm on Paul's device
		to leave at 2:40pm. Because Paul tends to get quite smelly during the day, he doesn't want Jack to think that
		he is unhygienic. Paul now also specifies that he wants a half an hour lead time to have a shower before leaving
		for Jack's. The alarm on his device is now updated to go off at 2:10pm.</p>
		
		<h1 class="center aligned ui header" id="code">Code</h1>
		
		<p>TravelReminder is an open source project with the intent of eventually becomming a free app on the Google
		Play Store.</p>

		<h2 class="ui header">Java</h2>
		<p>Since TravelReminder is an Android app, Java is a heavily featured programming language. Since I already have
		fairly strong skills in the language, I don't really count this as technology I learned, although there were some
		tips and tricks Android makes use of, such as interface callbacks, that were picked up along the way that weren't
		obvious to me before.</p>
		<h2 class="ui header">Android Development Tools</h2>
		<p>Android Development Tools is a plug-in for the Eclipse IDE. Apart from using Eclipse in my day job, I had no experience
		with using ADT. Thankfully, ADT is fantastically documented and well thought out. ADT generates a lot of code surrounding assets like
		layouts, strings (for translations), etc and also provides a visual editor for layouts, although this can be difficult to use if
		a good portion of your app dynamically fills out layouts, such as the main screen in the app which shows a list of all created reminders.</p>
		<p><a class="ui grey right labeled icon button" href="http://developer.android.com/tools/index.html">Get ADT <i class="right long arrow icon"></i></a></p>
		<h2 class="ui header">Google APIs</h2>
		<p>Two very important parts of the Google APIs were used in this project: the Maps API, and the Directions API. The maps API gives the user
		important feedback on where they're going and where they're coming from, as well as the route they'll take. The directions API provides
		probably the most important piece of the puzzle; the travel times. Both of these APIs were very easy to use and, again, are very well
		documented and thought out.</p>
